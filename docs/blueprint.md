## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong orange (#E67E22) to create a sense of determination and warmth
- Background color: Light, desaturated orange (#F8EFEA). A subtle complement to the primary orange to bring some calm to the app. 
- Accent color: Analogous yellowish color (#D4AC0D). Significantly different in saturation to highlight user interactions.
- Font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif that blends modern design with a touch of warmth. Suitable for both headings and body text, which allows its consistent use throughout the app without losing readability. 
- Use clear and simple icons to represent different exercises and actions (add, edit, delete).
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Subtle animations when adding, editing, or deleting exercises and logs.
